# Flo-Products Test

Hi applicant!

This repo contains the starter code for this test, as well as the task description. The intention with this test is to have a look at how you solve a pretty straight forward problem, and then discuss it afterwards.

- There is a file call db.js with a "database"-array with 1000 products. This is your database, you are _not_ supposed to set up any database service like MongoDB or write to file or persist data in any way.

- We're using the three categories `<meat, greens, fish>` in the pre-populated database, but feel free to let the user add more categories if you like - no right or wrong.


### Tasks

1. Users should be able to list all the products. It should be possible to filter by category, maximum and minimum price. You should have a size of 24 products per page. No libraries for the list/table of products.  

2. Users should be able to create products from a form page. The products should be appended to the database.

3. If you click in one product of the list, you should return the 6 products with nearest price in the same category.

4. You should create a navBar to navigate to the different pages of the website.


### Optional

* Ability to remain the filters after refreshing the website.

* Option to clear all the filters at the same time 

* Style the website 

* Use ES6 Features. 


### Delivery

Clone the repo, solve the tasks and push your code to a public GitHub repo. Send a link to the solution to flo@archerknight.com. Think about what you've sent as the production/final version of the app.
